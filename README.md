# Movie App using TMDB API (UIKit Programmatically Version)
This is a project I created to train and learn how to fetch data from API. This app features:
- List of Now Playing, Upcoming, and Top Rated movies.
- Movie details for each movie.
- Search movie based on movie's name.

This project is created for iOS platform, the tech stack I used in this projects are:
- Swift
- UIKit
- MVVM Design Pattern
- RxSwift
- TMDB API: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

Things I learn in this project:
- Programmatic UIKit: As I implemented UIKit programmatically in my project, I gained a deeper understanding of how the interface elements work together and how to customize them to fit my needs. This hands-on experience allowed me to learn new techniques and improve my overall proficiency in iOS development.
- MVVM with RxSwift: As I implemented RxSwift and MVVM in my project, I gained a better understanding of reactive programming concepts and how they can simplify code and improve application performance. This allowed me to write more efficient and maintainable code, while also improving the overall user experience of my application.
